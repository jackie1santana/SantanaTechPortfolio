This is a portfolio by Jackie Santana

I designed this porfolio with art and vision.

The technologies I used for most of my projects were: React, Vanilla Javascript, Paper.js, Howler.js & jQuery.

This has a firebase database for form data.

** Optimization **

- Jpeg Optimizer (compress images)
- TinyPNG (compress images)
- gzip compression on the server
- minified js with uglyfy

parcel bundler was a hassle with my pdf files so i just minified all files manually via online tools to save time. ( original files appear as "unminified")
